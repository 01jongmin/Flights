# Frontend
Download node, `cd frontend` and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
Run `npm start` to start the frontend locally.
Note, however, that the endpoint to which our frontend references is our production endpoint that is deployed on AWS.

# Backend
Reference [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to download rust.
`cd backend` and run `cargo run` to install the necessary dependencies ("crates") and run the backend locally on the 8000 port
